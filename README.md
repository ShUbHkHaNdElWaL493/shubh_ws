# Bot Simulation

This is a project focused on developing a bot for simulations.

## Features

- Implemented a 2-wheel differential drive bot for Gazebo simulations.
- Created a custom Gazebo world for simulations.
- Analyzed readings from the LiDAR scan of the bot.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**
- **Python**
- **ROS2 Jazzy**
- **Rviz2**
- **Gazebo OR Gazebo Sim Harmonic**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- ROS2 Jazzy
- Gazebo Sim Harmonic

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShUbHkHaNdElWaL493/shubh_ws.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory according to your preferred Gazebo version:
   ```bash
   cd shubh_ws/gz_sim
   ```
   ```bash
   cd shubh_ws/gazebo
   ```

### Usage
